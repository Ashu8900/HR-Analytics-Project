In the Power BI Dashboard report, I leverage the Atliq Hardware dataset covering employee activities over the three-month period of April, May, and June 2022. The primary objective is to extract insights regarding employee leave patterns and remote work tendencies. An intriguing observation surfaces, revealing that during May, there is a notable surge in employees opting for remote work, with a particular emphasis on Fridays. This prompts strategic considerations for scheduling meetings and key interactions.

The data underscores a practical approach to enhance engagement and productivity. Given the apparent trend of increased remote work on Fridays, it would be prudent to schedule crucial meetings and address important points for interaction on Mondays. This strategic decision aligns with the data-driven understanding that a greater number of employees are physically present on Mondays, offering an opportune time for collaborative discussions and task-oriented interactions. By aligning meeting schedules with the observed patterns, organizations can optimize their operational efficiency and communication strategies based on real-time insights derived from the dataset.
